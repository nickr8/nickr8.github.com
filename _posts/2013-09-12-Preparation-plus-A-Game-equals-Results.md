I had to take a test for the subject economics at my university today. I was well prepared but the test didn't go well. It was a flop.

Preparation is universally touted as a virtue. And I totally agree with it. If you're not prepared you can't perform, deliver or do your best.

However, what is sometimes forgotten is that preparation is only half the deal. The other half is the actual execution. The test that I wrote did not flop because I was unprepared. It went badly because I wasn't feeling it. I wasn't in the moment. I wasn't concentrated. I wasn't motivated and I didn't bring my *a-game*.

Bringing your a-game is vital when it comes to performing well at *anything*. You might have invested hundreds of hours of practice and preparation but when you don't bring your a-game all of that doesn't matter. So bring it!
