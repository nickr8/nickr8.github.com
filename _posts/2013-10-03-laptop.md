A laptop is not necessarily a laptop. There are *BIG* differences between them.

Since buying my MacBook Air this year, laptops have changed for me. When I use slow, big and heavy laptops I feel very uncomfortable because I know that it is possible to make and use *great* laptops.

When I open my work laptop I get an awful feeling. Not just because I have to immediately thing of work but also because I know that I will be using this super slow machine. Booting up takes forever. Opening outlook and a web browser takes even longer. It is just an awful experience. 

And when you want to carry it around you get the feeling that you are lugging a brick around with you. And the brick doesn't even look good!

If you don't need the horsepower for video editing or something similar and you have the cash you should seriously consider getting a MacBook Air or equivalent (like the Zenbook). There is just no reason to be using outdated equipment nowadays. It will change your life for the better.
