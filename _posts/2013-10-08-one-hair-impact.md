title: One Hair Impact

Sometimes one tiny thing can make a huge difference. 

For example today my brothers and I ordered food home from our local kebab restaurant. 

It took a while until it arrived and it was slightly cold when it arrived. I'm not such a fan of kebabs and the food being a little cold didn't make it any better. However, what made it *really* bad was one *really* small thing: a **hair**. 

As soon as I discovered the hair in my food I could no longer enjoy the food or think about anything else.

It's not like a hair will change the taste or consistency of the rest of the food but I associate many different things with a hair in my food. When I see that there is a hair in my food I start wondering how clean the place is and how they prepare the food. By that time it is already too late and I can't enjoy it any longer. 

This just shows what impact a single hair can have...
