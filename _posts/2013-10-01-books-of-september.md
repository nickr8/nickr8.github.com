This month I have been a reading machine. Here is a list of the books I have read this month and the key takeaway I got from each of them.

### [The Education of Millionaires: Everything You Won't Learn in College About How to Be Successful](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0052RDJFE/ref=oh_d__o04_details_o04__i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Key Takeaway: To be successful you don't need to go to college but rather you must acquire a certain skill-set: marketing, sales and networking. 

### [Play: How it Shapes the Brain, Opens the Imagination, and Invigorates the Soul](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B001SCK720/ref=oh_d__o06_details_o06__i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Key Takeaway: Play is deeply ingrained into humans and animals. If we stop playing we stop living. Play deficit should be viewed similar to sleep deficit.

### [This book will teach you how to write better](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00F209U6S/ref=oh_d__o07_details_o07__i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Key Takeaway: Write in a more casual style to sell more; there are a few copywriting rules that can make a big impact. 

### [Hacking Your Education: Ditch the Lectures, Save Tens of Thousands, and Learn More Than Your Peers EverWill](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0099CUNIO/ref=oh_d__o08_details_o08__i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Key Takeaway: You will learn more from the real world than you will from college. Education is lifelong and not just for a certain period of time.

### [Zen To Done: The Ultimate Simple Productivity System](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B001970HQU/ref=oh_d__o00_details_o00__i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Key Takeaway: Have only *one* goal per year and completely focus on it until you reach it. Have 4-6 weekly goals. Have 3 goals every day that you make sure to complete.

### [How to Shoot Video That Doesn't Suck: Advice to Make Any Amateur Look Like a Pro](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0051NHJFU/ref=oh_d__o01_details_o01__i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Key Takeaway: Number 1 rule of video is: don't bore your audience. That means fast cuts.

### [Contagious: Why Things Catch On](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B008J4GQKW/ref=oh_d__o02_details_o02__i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Key Takeaway: You can make anything more "contagious" by following the STEPPS acronym in the book.

### [The Icarus Deception: How High Will You Fly?](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00A8TUX32/ref=oh_d__o03_details_o03__i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Key Takeaway: Art is more than we think it is. Programming is art. Running a business is art. We must make art to be fit for the future. If you are just a keg in the machine you are doomed.

### [Growth Hacker Marketing: A Primer on the Future of PR, Marketing, and Advertising](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00BPDR3JM/ref=oh_d__o04_details_o04__i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Key Takeaway: You need a good product to make it easy for growth hacking. No good product, no growth hacking.

### [Trust Me, I'm Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0074VTHH0/ref=oh_d__o06_details_o06__i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Key Takeaway: Bloggers are just after page views. If you can create a story the can create page views bloggers will take it. If it's true or not.
