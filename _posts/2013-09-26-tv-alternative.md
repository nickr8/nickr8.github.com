I've never been a big TV watcher. TV is a passive medium, it has tons of ads and you don't learn squat. 

But sometimes you need some sort of passive entertainment. Sometimes even reading a book is too much when you are completely exhausted. 

For those situations I used to resort to aimlessly watching Youtube videos, browsing different channels and wasting my time.

I have now found a much better alternative of passive entertainment. It is called [creativeLive](http://www.creativelive.com). It was founded by Chase Jarvis (professional photographer) and offers a series of courses for creatives: photography, videography, web-design and business-related topics. 

The courses are free to watch live and they are rebroadcasted once. In one way it is a lot like TV. You have to watch it in real time (you have to pay if you want to download it) and it is a huge time suck. But the difference is that there is zero advertising and you really learn something. Especially when you watch a course which you are truly interested in.

I am writing this post during the 15 minute break of the creativeLive course "Overcome Fear to Get What You Want" with Noah Kagan. It has been quite interesting so far.

Say no to TV, watch creativeLive instead.
