title: Slow Internet

At the hotel that I am staying right now the internet is slow... REALLY slow.

The internet speed is something that I usually take for granted because I almost always have an internet connection that is fast enough to load any normal page within 5 seconds or less.

Right now with this shitty internet speed it takes half a minute just to load google.com â€” Freaking annoying. 

But although this super slow internet speed is driving me nuts, it does make me appreciate the internet speed back in Germany a lot more.
