I have been looking forward to going jet-skiing all week long. The last time I went jet-skiing was two years ago and it was a blast. 

So of course I had quite high expectations this time. When my brother and I climbed onto the jet-ski and started the motor I was really excited until something unexpected happened. I couldn't drive more than 20 km/h. The engine was artificially limited to that speed.

WHHAATTT???? I was soooo exited all this time and now this. I felt like I was going as fast as in a paddle boat. No fun. No fun at all.

This shows that high expectations aren't always that good. If I had had low expectations I would probably have enjoyed the ride, at least a little. Too bad...
