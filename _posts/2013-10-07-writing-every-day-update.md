Title: Writing Every Day Update

I have been writing *every single day* for a month now.

I don't think that it has necessarily improved my writing much but I do feel a lot more comfortable writing. When I started writing I thought about every single word I wrote. Now I just let the words flow and in the end go over to edit them.

This way of writing goes a lot faster and the process is a lot more enjoyable. 

I have been slacking with the length of my writing though. I started out writing posts with over 500 words. Now some of my posts are barely 100 words long. But I think its fine for now since I'm not writing anything serious. When I allow myself to write short posts I dread it less/ don't dread it at all and always get to write.

Because I think writing is such an important skill and useful for clarifying my thoughts I will continue to write short posts daily for the next month.

I'll be sure to post another update in a month again.
