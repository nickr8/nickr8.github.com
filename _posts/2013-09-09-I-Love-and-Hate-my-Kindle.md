title: I Love and Hate my Kindle

I have been reading all of my books on a Kindle for the last 2 years. There are things I like about it, love about it but also hate about it. *Hate* is a very strong word. *Dislike* would be more appropriate.

## What I like

- The design. It looks very minimalistic and feels good in my hands and is quite sturdy (yes, I have dropped it).
- Simplicity. Not only is the design simple, the UI design is also very simple. No distractions. It is possible to use a web browser on it but it is so slow that I have never used it seriously (I see that as a plus).
- Weight. It is very light which means that it is no problem to carry it around.
- Battery life. Battery life is *great*. Not sure how many hours but definitely enough to get you through multiple days of heavy reading without charging.

## What I love

- I just *love* how I can discover a new book and start reading it less than 2 minutes later. This is the real power of the Kindle. *Instant gratification*.

- I also *love* to have all my books in one place. No searching for lost books or having to decide which books to bring on a trip. They're *all* there.

## What I hate

On physical books I used to underline interesting passages, write my thoughts in the margins and fold the edges of interesting/important pages for future reference. This really helped me *remember* the things I read.

This is *not* possible on the Kindle. I know that there is a highlight and notes-taking feature but it is not comparable with the real deal. Every now and then I highlight passages but I never revisit them. The notes taking feature on the kindle is a joke. It takes about 5 minutes to write two sentences (I have the kindle with no touch). 

To circumvent the notes taking problem I have tried to keep a notepad open while reading books on my Kindle. I tried to write down important points but it is really not the same because the notes are not tied to specific pages. And I don't feel like writing a page number next to every single note I take. Also you have to "switch between mediums" when you want to write down a note. So I have stopped taking notes altogether. Not good. Especially since it is proven that taking notes and highlighting helps remembering the content.

My new tactic is to write a blog post on each book I read. This will help me remember the most important bits but it is still not the same. I miss notes.
