A couple posts ago I complained about the inability to write notes in the margins of Kindle ebooks. I thought about the problem and have come up with a solution.

I bought a box with index cards of the size A8. For each book that I read on my Kindle I take a new index card and write the name of the book and the author onto it. 

Then when I read a book and come along an interesting passage or I pick up something insightful, I take an index card and write it down and then file it behind the index card for the appropriate book.

This gives me the ability to record my thoughts and when I finish have finished the book go through the most important concepts and ideas by flipping through the index cards. No more rereading whole books with all the fluff. 

Now when I want to refresh my brain about some particular book, I just have to look at the index cards that I mad fro these .
