I have been using Spotify for over a month now. I'm still in the trial period but I'm sure that I'll continue to use it and start to pay for it. It simply ROCKS!!!

My brother has been using Spotify for quite some time now but I was hesitant for a long time since I'm not really a avid music listener and 10 Euros a month sounded like quite a bit for music. That's like buying a new Song on iTunes every 3 days, I thought.

But it is definitely worth it. It gives me the freedom to download *any* song. I don't have to think how much I will listen to the song before downloading it to justify the purchase since if I don't like it, I'll just delete it from my playlist again.

The effect of this is that I listen to a lot of more different songs than before since I'm not limited to the songs that I already purchased.

I also listen to more music period. Because I have such a large pool of songs to choose from I don't get tired of songs so I can listen to music non-stop all day. I mostly listen to music in my room on my Jawbone Jambox and on the way to the gym on my bluetooth headphones.

If you don't already have Spotify it is worth giving it a shot. It's free for the first 30 days too!
