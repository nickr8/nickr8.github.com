I used to take cold showers in the morning... But then I stopped.

But last week I started cold showers again at the gym. It is funny because when you come into the showering area there are 3 showers with 3 knobs for controlling the temperature. And every time all 3 are turned all the way to the left. The hot side. I guess cold showers aren't that popular at the gym.

Last Saturday, the first day I started taking cold showers again, the shock of ice cold water touching the skin was quite brutal. I began breathing really quickly in and out and rubbing my body with my hands to keep warm. Afterwards I was shivering.

Now, less than a week later the effects of a cold shower are still a little shocking in the first few seconds but then then my body adapts to the temperature really quickly. Cold showers are no longer painful but rather refreshing.

And it is very satisfying to leave the shower and see that one know is  turned all the way to the right.

You should definitely try out cold showers if you are not taking them already. It wakens you up like nothing else and it feels like you have more energy for about one hour after the shower. No caffeine needed.
