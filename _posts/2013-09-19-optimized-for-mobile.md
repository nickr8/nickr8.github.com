Yesterday I updated the css of this blog so that smartphones now display it correctly.

Before the changes the margins were HUGE on my Nexus 4. Now it's all normal-looking and easy to read.

I haven't had any real experience with developing sites for mobile devices so I had to learn some new CSS tricks. It's always fun to learn stuff that you know you'll be using in the future.

I think that the next website/project that I will start will be designed "mobile first" since smartphone and tablets are so popular nowadays and still on the rise.
