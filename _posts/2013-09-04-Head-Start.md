Title: Head Start Every Day

I have an unfair advantage. You want to know what it is? Well, it's simple: I *wake up one hour early* every day. That's it? Yes, and it's more awesome than it sounds.

I used to be very skeptical when I heard people preach waking up early. I knew that sleep was important and figured that these guys just get less sleep (which would suck) or just go to bed earlier. Going to bed earlier would defeat the purpose as it doesn't really matter if you have extra time in the evening or in the morning, or so I thought...

Well, it turns out that it does make a *big difference*. The last hour at night is not spent very productively. I often end up getting sucked into youtube or brainlessly peruse random blogs and social media streams. However, the first hour in the morning can easily made into your most productive hour in the day.

The reason behind this is that everyone else around you is asleep = *no distractions*. There are no noises, no one trying to contact you and nothing you still have to get done for the day. This gives you the most productive working environment you can imagine, one without distractions.

Additionally, in the morning you get to start fresh. Your thoughts and worries from the prior day are mostly gone/weakened since you have processed them in your sleep. That way you have a clear head and can concentrate 100% on what you want to do.

One last plus of getting up early is that you get the feeling that you are getting a *head start* since everyone around you is still sleeping while you're cranking out work or bettering yourself in some way. This gives you a great feeling that you are progressing in life. This feeling in the morning often stays and makes you have a great day. And that's what we're all after, right?

In the beginning of this post I wrote that I wake up "one hour early" every day. But what exactly does "one hour early mean"? Well, it just means that you wake up one hour earlier than you would *normally* do. So if you normally wake up at 7 AM so that you are ready for school/work on time, you should wake up at 6 AM. 

##What To Do In the Morning##

As an early riser you have full freedom of choice of what you want to to in that first hour. I'll give some suggestions of awesome things to kickstart your day with.

### Read

Reading is so important. I can't overemphasize it it. And by reading I don't mean reading news, websites, blogs or other crap. I'm talking about reading *books*.

If you don't read books, you've really missing out. So start reading!

### Write

Writing is a great way of clarifying your thoughts. And being a good writer will always be a valuable skill. And this is the way to develop it.

You might want to keep something like a diary or do it like me, start a blog.

### Do the most important work of the day

It is a good habit to start your day with your most dreaded task as Brian Tracy recommends in his book [*Eat That Frog!*](http://www.amazon.com/Eat-That-Frog-Great-Procrastinating/dp/1576754227). After you have completed your most dreaded task, there is nothing more to dread, you have the feeling of accomplishment and the rest of the day seems like a piece of cake.

### Clean up your working space
Clearing my desk really helps me get into a productive state. This, of course, only works if you work from home. But I can imagine that just cleaning your room in the morning will also have a positive effect on your productivity at work.

### Meditate

I am a big fan of 5 minute meditation. This is enough time for me to clear my head completely and stop the *monkey chatter*. Any longer and the returns seem diminishing (80/20 rule at its best). 

After meditation I feel very relaxed and concentrated which is the ideal prerequisite for some serious work. 

If you're not sure how to meditate check out the book [*Mindfulness in Plain English*](http://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Plain-English-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0861719069). It is a good book that taught me how to meditate. The author advises to always increase your meditation time, but I think 5 minutes are long enough.

### Do the Miracle Morning

The [*Miracle Morning*](http://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Morning-Not-So-Obvious-Guaranteed-ebook/dp/B00AKKS278/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1378363013&sr=1-1&keywords=miracle+morning) is the book that got me started in being an early riser. Hal Elrod, the author, gives a lot of helpful advice on how to start being an early riser and why you should become one. 

The essence of the book is a routine which one is advised to do which consists of the the following: Silence, Affirmations, Visualisation, Exercise, Reading and Scribing.

Ok, so that's all I have to say about waking up early. I hope you give it a shot if you are not an early riser already. 

If you are still not convinced that waking up early is right for you just know that a very large percentage of very [successful people are early risers](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/17/the-first-thing-these-suc_n_3588482.html). Chance? I don't think so. 

One last remark: Although I wake up early almost every day, I sometimes have *cheat days* where I go to bed *really* late and then don't set the alarm clock (usually on Fridays-Saturdays). It's a little like the *cheat day* in the [*4-Hour Body*](http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-incredible-superhuman-ebook/dp/B004M8S3Y6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1378364240&sr=8-1&keywords=4+hour+body) but with wake-up time instead of food.
