Because I am on vacation I am on a totally different rhythm than usual. That's why vacation at a different place is so great. Not only do you get to see a new environment but you also get on a different schedule and are forced to do different things or the same things differently.

That is probably part of the reason why I forgot to do a blog post yesterday. Usually when I wind down and the day comes to an end I write a blog post but yesterday I didn't really wind down near a computer. I rather went on a walk after a huge dinner. After that I was so tired that I just plopped into bed and fell asleep.

Because the vacation rhythm is so different than the usual day-to-day rhythm it is great because you get some variety. Without it you start to go nuts. Doing things the same way every day I think I'd go nuts. I'm human and not a machine!
