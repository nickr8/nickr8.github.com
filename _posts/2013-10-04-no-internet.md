Today there was no internet for about 5 minutes.  This might sound like no big deal but it showed just how dependent I am on it.

I wanted to check out the Mac App store when I noticed that the page wasn't loading. I then tried to access some websites to see if there was a problem with the internet or with the App store. There was definitely a problem with the internet. 

Usually I would directly go to the router, plug it out and plug it in again. This usually resolves "broken" internet but today my cat Celine was lying on my lap and I didn't want to put her down immediately.

So I looked to see what I could do on the computer â€” without internet. I came to the realization that a computer without internet is quite useless. Almost everything I do on the computer involves the internet. The browser is the application that is used the most. By far.

So after maybe 5 minutes I put Celine down and plugged the router our and in again. 

Now I have internet again. And I appreciate it even more now.
