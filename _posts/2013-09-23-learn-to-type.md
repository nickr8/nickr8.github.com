I used to be a *really* slow typist. When I took a typing speed test I typed at about 30 - 40 WPM (words per minute). I then saw a video on [appsumo.com](http://www.appsumo.com) where they showed 5 productivity "hacks". One of them was to learn how to touch type. They showed how to practice touch typing by using [Typeracer](http:www.typeracer.com).

Since then I have been somewhat addicted to Typeracer. I play it almost every day (but not for long) and I have seen my typing speed steadily improve. My typing speed is now almost always above 60 WPM.

This is still not super fast but it is definitely fast enough so that typing is no longer a handicap for me. This is very liberating since when I want to write a long email it is not a big task anymore, but something I enjoy. 

I just love hearing the fingers "clacking" on the keyboard and seeing the curser on the screen race from left to right.

If you don't already touch type, I highly recommend you learn how to and improve it until you reach at least 50 WPM average.
