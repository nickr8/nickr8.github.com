I read quite a few books. 

There is never a time when I do not have an open (virtually open on my Kindle, of course) book that is ready to be read. I go through about 1-2 books a week. 

The best part of the whole reading process is by far when I finish a book and it is time to choose a new one. The urge is so strong that when I am finishing a book I can hardly concentrate on it and try to read as fast as I can only to get to shop for a new book.

Sometimes I think that this is not such a good thing as I am always getting new books without rereading old books. But I just love to chose books so much that I think that I will be buying new books in the foreseeable future.

I just finished a book half an hour ago. So I'll be off to Amazon now choosing a new book...
