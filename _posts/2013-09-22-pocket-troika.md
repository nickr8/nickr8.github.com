Whenever I leave the house I make sure to take 3 things with me: my wallet, keys and smartphone. Each item serves its own purpose. However, I expect that in 5 years we will only have to carry one. The smartphone.

**The wallet**: Technological advances make it possible to pay with services like Google Wallet via NFC. Now we just have to wait until the retailers adopt the technology... 

And for all of the extra plastic cards that I have to carry around in my wallet... it's RIDICULOUS!! Why do all my membership cards have to be made out of plastic??? I'm glad to say that there is trend that is going away from plastic cards (for example you can get monthly tickets for the train digitally) but it is still far from being everywhere.

**The keys**: This one is a little bit trickier. But with devices coming out like [Lockitron](https://lockitron.com/preorder) I see how smartphones will take over keys as the main locking/unlocking devices. Smartphones are just a lot more flexible. I expect it to take some time until the majority of locks are unlockable by smartphones but I see it happening nonetheless.

Looking forward to the future. One device for everything. But if you lose it, you're screwed.
