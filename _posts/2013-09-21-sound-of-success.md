This evening while I was making dinner I suddenly heard a loud roar coming from the street. I immediately jumped to the window to see what kind of car was driving by. And it was an....

... **ASTON MARTIN**!!!!

Sweet! I tried to see who was sitting inside of the beautiful car but it was already quite dark so I couldn't really see (maybe it was a self driving Aston Martin from Google, who knows...). 

This is what I always do when I see a supercar: Look who's driving it. Mostly it is some old dude with grey hair. But once in a while you see a young dude. I want to be that dude. 

It's not like having a supercar will make anyone happy on its own but it definitely shows that the person has had financial success to some degree...

... and it is just plain *cool* driving one.
