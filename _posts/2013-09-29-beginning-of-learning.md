As I wrote about yesterday, I got a new ukulele. I have been practicing for at least 2 hours now (that includes watching Youtube videos) and am amazed by how much I have progressed. 

While I didn't even know how to tune a ukulele yesterday, I have already learned 4 chords by now. I am still not able to play whole songs as the switching between chords is quite tricky but I am still quite happy with my learning progression. It just goes to show how much one really learns at the beginning of a learning phase.

I am confident that I will be able to play some songs by the end of the year on the ukulele now.
