Now that I have to drive to work every day again I also have to endure the traffic jams, the red lights and the stop and go.

The first day on the job this week the drive was quite painful because I wasn't doing anything during the drive (except driving of course). After that, however, I downloaded podcasts from [Mixergy](www.mixergy.com) to my smartphone to listen to during the drive.

Now that I have something fun to do while driving I don't really want to stop driving. If I get stuck in a traffic jam I don't mind because I know that every minute that I'm in the car I get to listen to the podcast which is fun for me.
