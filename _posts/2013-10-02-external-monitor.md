 For the last 6 months I have been exclusively using monitors no bigger than 13.3 inches large.
 
 However, yesterday the VGA to thunderbolt adapter for my MacBook Air arrived which now enables me to connect my laptop to my large monitor. 
 
 All I can say is that it feels awesome to use a 23 inch screen again. Those extra 10 inches really do help.
 
 It feels less crammed and you can have half a webpage on the one half of the screen and a second page on the other half. And the pages are still fully intact and not totally squished like with the 13 inch MacBook air! This means that I can be following a tutorial on Youtube while implementing the advice at the same time. Nice.
 
 Now when I use my MacBook air I start missing the large screen again.
