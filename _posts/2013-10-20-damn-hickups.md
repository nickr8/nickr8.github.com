Today at the beach I got hickups. This doesn't really happen to me very often.. but when it does happen, it really gets me. 

I'd normally just drink a glass of water upside-down and then the hickups disappear instantly... but I didn't have a glass of water. I was at the *beach*.

So I didn't do anything. Except for hickuping (Is that even a word?). Of course my brothers noticed pretty quickly because my hickups are pretty loud. They gave me great tips like "just hold your breath"... (I hope you sense the irony).

I had the hickups for forever and suddenly I noticed that they were gone. What a relief.

So now at almost all times I can be thankful that I don't have hickups at the moment.
