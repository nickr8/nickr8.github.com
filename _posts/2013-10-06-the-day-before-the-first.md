When I have my first day at school, first day at a job or first day at *anything* I always have a certain feeling in my stomach the day before.

It is a mix of excitement and fear of the unknown and it makes it hard to fall asleep. 

Today it is one of those days. Its the day before the first day in a new division at work. I'm somewhat excited and afraid at the same time.

I sure hope that I won't be having trouble falling asleep tonight.
