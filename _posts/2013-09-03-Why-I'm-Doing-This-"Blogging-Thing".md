Blogs were cool, hip and new... *years* ago. Now they are kind of *passé*, right? Well, that might be true but I am not writing this blog to be cool or hip.

I am writing this blog mainly for *myself* to become a better writer and clarify my thoughts about my experiences, books, and other interesting topics.

So if this blog is mainly for myself, why am I putting it on a blog that can be viewed by anyone in the whole world? The reason for this is simply that it is more *fun* to write on a blog than in a diary. Also, some of my posts might help someone out, I might get feedback and meet like-minded people through it. That would be awesome, right?

A little history on my writing:

In school I always *hated* writing essays. At first the act of writing felt like pulling out my own hair. Slow and painful. Later I learned how to whip out papers like a machine. However, I still didn't enjoy it (and wasn't particularly talented at it either).

I never really tried writing for myself until after school. I took a stab at writing in a diary but I still didn't *enjoy* the experience. So this is my attempt to write for fun and make it into an enjoyable hobby.

So that I don't get sidetracked I set up a repeating reminder in my Google Calendar for Mondays that says "PUBLISH POST!". So, if everything goes according to plan there will be a new post every Monday. *Knock on wood*

Have fun on my blog!
