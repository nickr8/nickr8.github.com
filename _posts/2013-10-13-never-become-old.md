Today I arrived in Gran Canaria with my family. The first thing we really did was go to the beach. We walked along the beach and eventually got to the FKK part. "FKK" stands for "Frei Körper Kultur" which basically means that people walk around butt-naked.

On that beach I saw some *very* disturbing things. 80 % of the naked people were over 60 and their body showed it. Everything was wrinkled up and hanging down with lots of fat and loose skin — absolutely DISGUSTING!

After that my brothers and me were chilling in our hotel and watching some TV. On it there was a show that talked about how many seniors are *really bad* drivers. They did tests with some of them... they were completely inept and their reaction times were like 3 seconds long — scary. 

After today's experiences I really don't wan't to become old. Hopefully by the time I'm that age, scientists will have invented some cool stuff so that I won't look / act like those old people on the beach and on TV...
