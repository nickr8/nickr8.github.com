Every time I feel stressed out the reason for it is internal. 

I might feel pressure living up to the expectations that friends, family, teachers, bosses and society put on me to become a certain type of person or behave and perform in a certain way.

But although it might feel as though the pressure is coming from all these external sources, in reality the only person who can really stress you out is.... wait for it....... YOU!

No one can make you feel stressed without your permission.

So next time you're stressed out think about it and question if you really want to feel stressed and what the source behind the stress really is. Is it stress that comes from pursuing your goals or is it stress because you are afraid that you will disappoint someone else?
