title: Interest When Learning

The last couple of days have been "studying days" for me as I have close to 10 exams over the next two weeks.

It is too bad that almost none of the subjects really interest me as this impacts my learning in a negative way. When I study a subject that I find boring I have to concentrate super hard to learn anything at all. When trying to understand new concepts I have to read the explanation several times until I grasp them.

When you compare this to when I learn things that interest me, like web programming, the difference is like night and day. It is not that one is easier than the other but it is easier to learn because I have more fun learning something that I am interested in. It's like work vs. play.

When studying for school I set a timer for 30 minutes. When the timer goes off I take a break for 10 minutes. The feeling when the timer goes off: *relief*. I sometimes do the same when learning something that interests me so that I don't do it for too long so I still get some *uninteresting work* done. The feeling when the timer goes off: *disappointment*.

That's the difference. When learning things that interest me I don't just have an easier time learning but I also spend more time learning it and have fun at the same time.
