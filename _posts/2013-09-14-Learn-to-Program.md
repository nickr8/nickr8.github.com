It is becoming increasingly popular to encourage young people to learn how to program. There are [whole campaigns](http://code.org/) trying to get all kids to learn how to program.

However, I think the reasoning behind this trend is flawed. Most people that say that everyone should learn how to code states that there is a huge need for programmers and that in the future everyone will need to have programming skills to get a job. While this might be true, I think you should learn to program for a different reason.

Learn to program so that you *understand the digital world* around you. When a non-programmer goes to a website, he has no idea how it works. It's like magic. A programmer might not exactly know how the website was built, but at least has knowledge of the fundamental structure that lies behind it.

Not only does one understand more but people with programming knowledge can do cool projects too. They can program web sites (like this one for example) or write little scripts or even some apps. A couple days ago I was a frustrated at the tedious process of publishing a post. So I wrote a small shell script that automates the whole process. Now I just have to type `publish` and hit enter. Cool, right?

Also, not everyone is wired to become a professional programmer. I, for example, would not be a great programmer if I tried to program as my main job. I have other strengths. So if your strength is programming, great. Go ahead and become a programmer. But if not, don't fret. Still learn to program (everyone can learn the basics) but follow your strengths.
