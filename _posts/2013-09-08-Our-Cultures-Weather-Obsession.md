title: Our Culture's Weather Obsession

Today I was not waken by my alarm clock but by the sound of rain hitting my window. So the first thought today was "crap, bad weather".

I didn't plan on doing anything outside today but the fact that there was *bad weather* put me in a slightly grumpy mood. This makes *no sense* at all. Why should the climate have *any* influence on my mood when I was planning on staying indoors all day anyway?

In our culture the topic *weather* has become way to important. It is a clich√© conversation starter as it's always there and everybody can talk about it. For example, when I call my grandmother one of the things that is *always* mentioned is "How is the weather over there?". 

But it really shouldn't matter what the weather is like if it does not alter your day in an important way. If you were planning on doing a bike race but it was cancelled because of rain you have a valid point. But even then, most of the talk about weather is rather *complaining* about weather. And because you have no influence on the weather whatsoever, complaining is futile. 

So let's stop letting our moods be affected negatively by weather and let's stop complaining about it.
