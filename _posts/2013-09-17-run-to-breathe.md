Sometimes I forget to breathe. No joke. 

When I'm all stressed out about something, like my exams for instance, my breathing becomes very shallow and I get nasty headaches.

I have found that there are two ways to fight this effectively (without the use of drugs).

1. Breathe deliberately. This can be done while meditating or just sitting still. Really focus on your breath as you breathe in and out.. in and out.. .in and out......
2. Run.

My preferred approach is to run outside. When you run you automatically breathe harder and take in more oxygen. This fights headaches really well and movement is good for reducing stress anyways. So it's a win-win situation.

Next time you're all stressed out and are getting a headache just grab a pair of running shoes and go for a run outside to get yourself some fresh air. Your mind and body will thank you.
