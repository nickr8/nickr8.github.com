title: So Excited I Can't Sleep

Two days ago I went to bed at 10 PM but couldn't fall asleep until 1 AM the next day. All just because I was excitement about an idea.

The idea was simple: Make a web app that lets you create a resume in markdown and then styles it with css so that it looks really good. I thought about this Idea because I updated my resume earlier and it was a real pain to do so. I ended up doing it in LaTeX which was not a pleasurable experience (especially because I didn't have any prior knowledge about the LaTeX).

This is a common and reoccurring theme with me. I get super excited about an idea I have. I then go on to write it down, sketch it out and have a very clear mental picture of it. Then the excitement fades and I stop thinking about it. 

Next time when I am that excited about an idea I will try to not only sketch it out but also use the energy of that excitement to create a real prototype of it and develop it as far as possible.
