I've always had a sweet tooth. I like crepes, pan cakes, cookies... most sweet things. 

But I have also always had it under control pretty well. I usually have enough self-control to say NO to most things containing tons of sugar.

Today, however, I let that self control slip a little. Today is the first day of vacation for me and I somehow felt the need to eat sweet stuff. 

So when I came home the first thing that I eat was a peanut butter, chocolate kiss cookie. Then I made french toast with powdered sugar and maple syrup on top. And after that I had another cookie.

After a couple hours or so when I got hungry again I went and eat a vanilla yoghurt and then had vanilla ice-cream with chocolate chips on top.

So much for self-control... I guess today was cheat day for me.
