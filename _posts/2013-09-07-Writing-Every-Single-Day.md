Title: Writing Every Single Day
Date: 2013-09-07

So when I started this blog I imagined that I would write one post a week. This quota was just multiplied by 7. New goal: **write every day**.

I was motivated to do this after reading this in Seth Godin's book [*The Icarus Deception: How High Will You Fly?*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Icarus-Deception-High-ebook/dp/B0090UOLEW)[^book]:

[^book]: I haven't finished the book yet but I can already say that I like it and recommend it.

> Do it every day. Every single day. Not a diary, not fiction, but analysis. Clear, crisp, honest writing about what you see in the world. Or want to see. Or teach (in writing). Tell us how to do something.
>
>If you know you have to write *something* every single day, even a paragraph, you will improve your writing. 

Because I will be writing a post *every single day* from now on the posts will be quite short. That also means that they also won't be as in-depth but they will also be easier to *digest*. 

In exactly one month I will post a review of how I experienced "writing every day".
