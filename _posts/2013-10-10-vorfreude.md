At the end of this week I am going to Gran Canaria for a 10 day vacation with my family. I am really looking forward to it. 

It is funny how looking forward to something can make some things bearable. For example when I was in school the thought of flying to America made the weeks before vacation bearable. 

Now dreaming about my vacation makes work bearable.

Vacation is a little bit like dessert. While eating the healthy stuff you are looking forward to the dessert which is a treat. Same with work and vacation. 

Vacation is the treat that comes after work.
