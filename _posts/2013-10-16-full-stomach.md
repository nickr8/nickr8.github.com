Since the beginning of my vacation I have been having breakfast and dinner at the hotel buffet. I have been eating so much that my stomach feels like bursting after every meal.

I know it is not the most healthy thing to do and it doesn't even feel that good. I'm not quite sure why it happens to be honest. I somehow just have the drive to eat as much until nothing else fits anymore.

I think the reason for it might be that at home there is never really enough food to eat as much as I want to eat. Now that there is, my instinct tells me to go ahead and eat as much as possible.

I really have to get my instinct under control...
