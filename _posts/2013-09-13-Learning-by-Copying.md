Yesterday I was creating the CSS (styling) for this blog but since I am not that experienced with CSS (yet), I decided to start by **copying** the styling of another blog which has very good styling ([mnmlist.com](http://mnmlist.com)).

*Learning by doing* is a very popular mantra. I fully agree that *doing* it more effective than just reading about a subject. When you are just getting started, however, doing should mostly consist of *copying great work*. Later on you can develop your own style. 

This is the case when learning most skills. 

To become a better artist you copy the art of great artists. To become a better copywriter you copy the work of great copywriters. To become a better designer you copy the design of great designers. You get the point.
