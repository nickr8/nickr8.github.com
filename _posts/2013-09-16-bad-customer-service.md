title: Bad Customer Service

Today i went to MediaMarkt (similar to BestBuy) to check out some DSLRs. 

To my disappointment all the DSLRs were locked-up in a vitrine. So naturally, I looked around to see if there was an employee nearby to unlock the vitrine so that I could hold the DSLRs in my hands. I looked around and...

Nothing. There were no employees in sight. So I waited, and waited and waited... until a group of 3 MediaMarkt employees walked by. They were talking with each other and joking around. Good for them that they were enjoying themselves but this caused them not to notice that there was a customer needing help and it didn't make them seem approachable.

So I went up to the group and asked if one of them could open the vitrine. One guy got out his keys and unlocked the vitrine for me. I tried out a couple of the DSLRs. Unfortunately none really worked. Some had no battery power left, others didn't have a SD card.

Instead of interacting with me the dude just stood there next to me, giving me the feeling that I should finish up. So I asked him a question about a camera and he answered it. But nothing more. So I said "thank you" and left.

This is an example of *bad* customer service.

here are a couple of things that MediaMarkt should do to improve their customer service:

1. Don't have cameras locked behind vitrines. People want to actually hold the thing in their hands und *use* them. And asking an employee to unlock it is definitely a barrier to the purchase.
2. Have the cameras ready to use. Full battery and SD card. Otherwise cameras are useless.
3. Don't have all employees lumped together. Spread them apart so that every area of the store has at least one person responsible for the customers in it.
4. Make your employees be more attentive. If they see someone that is *clearly* interested in a product they should approach.
5. Have your employees be more interactive. Instead of just answering questions with yes and no make them ask the buyer questions. For example: "what are you going to use the camera more for? Video or stills?".

I hope MediaMarkt changes some of the things I listed. But it might already be to late for them. I and many other people I know have transitioned to buying most of their electronics on Amazon. Go figure.
