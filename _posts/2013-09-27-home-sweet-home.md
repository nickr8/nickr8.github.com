Today I came back home after being away for more than 3 months. That might not sound like that long of a time but it sure felt that way.

I was so happy to be back home again. To see my mom, my brothers, be in the comfy living-room and sleep in my own bed. 

This shows that you especially value things if you have not been around them for a long time. This is true for people, as it is true for material objects, locations etc...

So if you don't value something take a break from it for a while and when you come back to it after some time you might appreciate it more. 

Let's see how long the appreciation lasts.
