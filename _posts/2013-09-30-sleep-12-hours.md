When you sleep for almost 12 hours you know that something is off. And Yesterday I did exactly that. I slept close to 12 hours. 

I went to bed at 10 PM and woke up at around 9:30 AM. That's 11 and a half hours of sleep!!! The day before that I already felt a little sick with small headaches here and there. But now I really know that I am recovering from something.

I'll go to bed at 10 PM today again and see when I will wake up tomorrow...

I find it very interesting that I tend to get sick right after stressful periods (like in this case two weeks full of exams) when my vacation starts. 

I guess that the body tries to stay healthy while it has to perform and when the tension fades the body takes the opportunity to get the sickness out of the way.
