Today my new ukulele arrived in the mail. I am going to learn the ukulele in the coming months with the goal of being able to play a couple of songs by the end of this year (for example the "4 chord medley").

I was inspired to do so after watching the TEDx talk by Josh Kaufman in which he explained that one could learn almost any skill to some degree after practicing for 20 hours. One of the skills that he learned was the ukulele. He demonstrates his skills at the end of the video:

After unpacking my new ukulele I learned how to tune the "uke" and started practicing the C and F chord until my fingers started hurting. I will continue to practice in the coming months until I reach a certain proficiency.
