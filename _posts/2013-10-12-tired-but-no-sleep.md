Today I have been kinda tired. I didn't get much good sleep  yesterday. That's probably the reason why.

But it is very strange because although I feel tired (and a little cranky) I still don't feel like sleeping...

Because I am flying to Gran Canaria tomorrow and have to leave the house at 3 AM it doesn't even really make sense to go to bed... But then I will be even more tired!!!

We'll see how it goes. I hope I'll get some quality sleep... even if I don't feel like going to sleep.
